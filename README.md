# Energy Consumption & Emission Analysis (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global **energy consumption, production, emissions, GDP, and population** data using SQL.

The goal is to understand how energy usage, economic growth, and population trends influence global carbon emissions and to identify country-level performance, efficiency patterns, and sustainability insights.

---

## Business Problem
Rising energy demand and carbon emissions make it difficult to balance economic growth with environmental sustainability.

Decision-makers often lack integrated analysis connecting:
- Energy Consumption
- Energy Production
- CO₂ Emissions
- GDP
- Population

This project provides structured SQL-based analysis to generate meaningful insights from multi-table datasets.

---

## Database Structure
The project consists of **6 relational tables**:

- **Country** – Master table containing unique country identifiers  
- **Emission_3** – CO₂ emissions by country, year, and energy type  
- **Consumption** – Energy consumption by country and year  
- **Production** – Energy production by country and year  
- **GDP_3** – Yearly GDP data  
- **Population** – Yearly population data  

All tables are connected using **Country** as the primary linking attribute.  
Time-based analysis is performed using the **Year** column.

## Tools & Technologies
- MySQL (Version 8+)
- SQL (CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregations, Joins)
- Relational Database Design

## Key Analytical Areas

### 1. General & Comparative Analysis
- Total emissions per country (latest year)
- Top 5 GDP countries
- Production vs Consumption comparison
- Energy types contributing most to emissions

### 2. Trend Analysis
- Year-over-year global emission trends
- GDP growth trends by country
- Population vs emission patterns
- Per-capita emission changes over time

### 3. Ratio & Per-Capita Analysis
- Emission-to-GDP ratio (carbon intensity)
- Energy consumption per capita
- Production per capita
- Energy intensity (consumption relative to GDP)

### 4. Global Comparisons
- Top 10 countries by population & emissions
- Global emission share by country
- Global average GDP, emission & population trends
- Correlation between GDP growth and energy production growth

## Key Insights
- Emissions are heavily concentrated among a few major economies (China, USA, India).
- Fossil fuel-based energy sources dominate global CO₂ emissions.
- Larger populations contribute to higher total emissions, even when per-capita emissions are lower.
- Energy intensity (energy use per GDP) varies significantly across countries.
- Developed countries generally show higher per-capita energy usage compared to developing economies.
- Some countries demonstrate better economic output per unit of energy, indicating higher efficiency.

---

## Sample Business Interpretation
- Countries with higher energy consumption than production may depend on energy imports.
- High emission-to-GDP ratios indicate carbon-intensive economies.
- Per-capita metrics help differentiate between scale effects (population size) and development level.

---

## Project Highlights
- Designed normalized relational schema
- Implemented complex joins across multiple datasets
- Used CTEs and window functions (LAG, AVG OVER) for trend and growth analysis
- Calculated Pearson correlation using SQL
- Converted analytical outputs into business-level insights

---

## Assumptions & Notes
- Analysis performed using **MySQL 8+** (required for CTEs and window functions)
- Emission values represent **CO₂ emissions (kt CO₂)**
- GDP values are expressed in **USD (billions)**
- Some insights are observational and not based on statistical regression

---

## Conclusion
Energy consumption and emissions are strongly linked to economic growth, industrialization, and population scale.

A small group of countries contributes a significant share of global emissions. Improving energy efficiency and accelerating renewable energy adoption remain critical for sustainable development.
